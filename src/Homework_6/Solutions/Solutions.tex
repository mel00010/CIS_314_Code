\begin{enumerate}
	\setcounter{enumi}{1}
	\item The code snipped given requires 3 stalls without forwarding.  This is
	because the second instruction, \texttt{mrmovl}, has no dependency
	on the first instruction, \texttt{addl}, as the first instruction only reads
	\texttt{\%edx}, and is done reading it in the decode stage.  However, the third
	instruction, \texttt{addl} requires three stalls, as it has to wait for
	\texttt{mrmovl} to write back to \texttt{\%edx}.  By that time, the
	first \texttt{addl} has finished writing to \texttt{\%eax}, \texttt{addl}'s
	other data dependency.  
	
	With forwarding, this code requires 1 stall.  This is because of a load/use
	hazard on the last two instructions, which cannot be resolved with forwarding
	completely.
